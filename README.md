## Summary  
In this analysis we are comparing a group of 15 high schools and looking at their passing rates in math, reading, and overall.  We are also comparing them by type of school (District schools or Charter schools), and by the amount of spending per student.   
Additional analysis can be found in the PyCitySchools_starter file.
